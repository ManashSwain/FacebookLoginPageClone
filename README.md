Facebook Login Page Clone

Welcome to our Facebook login page clone project! This project aims to replicate the user interface of the Facebook login page using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.

URL : The project is live at https://manashswain.github.io/FacebookLoginPageClone/

Description

This webpage mimics the design and layout of the Facebook login page, providing users with a familiar interface for logging into their Facebook accounts. While this project focuses solely on the front-end design, it closely resembles the appearance and functionality of the original Facebook login page, including:

    Login Form: A form allowing users to enter their email/phone and password to log in.
    "Forgot Password" Link: A link for users who have forgotten their password, leading to the password recovery process.
    "Create New Account" Button: A button for users who don't have a Facebook account to create a new one.

Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

Once you have the files locally, you can open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to access the Facebook login page clone.
Usage

    Login: Enter your email/phone and password to log in to your Facebook account.
    Forgot Password: If you've forgotten your password, click on the "Forgot Password?" link to initiate the password recovery process.
